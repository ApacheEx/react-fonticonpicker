# React FontIconPicker Component

A react version of [fontIconPicker](https://fonticonpicker.github.io). This is
rewritten and is not a wrapper around jQuery version.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently **dev setup** is done. This is my first. So pardon the incorrectness.

## Running Development

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Will open a webpack dev server with hot reload.
